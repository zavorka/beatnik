### Prerequisities
* Android Studio 2.2 Preview 3+
* Android NDK r12b+

### Building

1. Clone this repo together with its submodules recursively

```
git clone --recurse git@github.com:zavorka/beatnik
```

2. ??? I'm pretty sure stuff changed a lot during this whole year I haven't touched the code since the C++-part of the build system I used was still experimental back in the days.
